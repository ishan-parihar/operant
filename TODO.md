# Operant task ledger

Autonomous mode (`operant autonomous`, `operant run --autonomous`) reads this
file (`[autonomous] todo_path`): it works the `## Pending` list, runs
`[autonomous] test_command`, commits to `[autonomous] git_branch`, and records
progress in `autonomous-status.toml`. Only the `## Implemented` and
`## Pending` sections are parsed. Anything that needs an owner decision belongs
in `## Review`, which autonomous mode never touches.

## Implemented

- TUI rows render once while tools run (iter-797)
- Synchronous, viewport-independent drag copy (iter-797, iter-801)
- Reasoning display: jcode Current semantics by default (iter-797)
- Streams outlive `timeout_secs`; stream drops always earn retries (iter-799)
- Large pastes reach the model, not their placeholder (iter-800)
- Copy is clean document text: logical lines, no gutters, no tool rows (iter-801)
- Copy carries no chrome: system cards rejoin; code, quote, table as text (iter-802)
- Tool-loop guardrails warn the model and stop the turn cleanly (iter-805)
- Selection highlights only the text a copy carries (iter-806)
- oh-my-pi shortcuts, conflict-checked; `[tui] external_editor` (iter-807)
- Essential commands wired (`/compact`, `/cancel`, `/transcript`, `/changelog`, `/refresh-model-list`, `/auth`, `/goals`); jcode-only commands removed (iter-808)
- 35 more dead commands purged; wiring pinned by `no_registered_tui_command_is_unwired` (iter-817)
- Help/keys overlays generated from the keybinding registry; `/permissions` picker; Shift+Tab no longer cycles permission mode (iter-820)
- Visibility toggles: Ctrl+T thinking, Ctrl+Shift+O/Alt+O tools; copy mode on Alt+Y (iter-821)
- Reasoning effort end-to-end: config → request shape (per-provider) → rejection fallback → Shift+Tab/picker (iter-829)
- Cancel preserves context: typed `Error::Interrupted`, tail committed with synthetic tool results, interruptible tools, 3s watchdog (iter-832)
- Fullscreen `/rewind` selector over the real transcript; double-Esc opens it; forks are parent-linked sessions (iter-838)
- Web search and browser are sourcehound-only; memory is memory-wire-only (MEMORY.md/USER.md imported once) — alternates accepted-with-warning then ignored (iter-842/843/846)
- Subprocess hygiene: child stderr drains (no 64KB-pipe freezes), warmups reaped (no zombies), tool-output retention budgeted at 4MB (iter-848/850)
- `operant debug memory` + `docs/MEMORY_BUDGET.md` footprint surfaces (iter-851)
- Memory banks: `bank_for(identity, scope)` — seat banks (`emp:*`) isolated from the personal bank (iter-856)
- Terminal-scroll watermark keyed on message boundaries, not rows (BUGS K-3, iter-887)

## Pending

- Rebuild `/settings` over `operant.toml` (toml_edit, comments kept), tabs per config section, live-apply where supported; retire the legacy settings.json screen
- `[keybindings]` user overrides in `operant.toml` (`/keys` now shows the effective registry bindings + conflicts — iter-820; overrides remain)
- Unify the gateway's `agent.show_reasoning` with the TUI reasoning display mode

## Review

Owner decisions — not autonomous work:

- Context management (magic-context review): agent-driven reduction (`ctx_reduce`) and a background historian instead of the synchronous summarize rung — larger core changes
- BUGS.md R42-8: two live Telegram bot tokens unredacted in gateway.log
