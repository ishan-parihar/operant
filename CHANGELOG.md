## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Shared TOML-backed `AppConfig` runtime configuration across `hermes-cli` and `hermes-core`
- Config discovery with precedence `defaults < hermes.toml/.hermes.toml/config.toml < env vars < CLI flags`
- Config sections for client, agent behavior, TUI, MCP, skills, gateway, and tool/runtime defaults
- Responsive ratatui application architecture with landing and workspace views split across dedicated state, action, form, render, and app modules
- In-TUI panels for Session, MCP, Skills, and Behavior management, including modal forms for MCP server creation, skill creation, and behavior editing
- Example-config parse coverage to keep `hermes.example.toml` synchronized with the Rust config schema
- GitHub release workflow that extracts matching release notes from `CHANGELOG.md` and publishes tagged build artifacts to GitHub Releases

### Changed

- Replaced ad hoc CLI-only config parsing with shared core config loading and runtime installation
- Moved runtime-tunable defaults and provider/tool endpoints out of scattered literals in `client`, `agent`, `gateway`, `web_tools`, `http_tool`, `terminal_tool`, and `code_execution`
- Reworked rich `run` and `chat` flows to launch the new TUI instead of the previous single-screen live monitor
- Updated build workflow artifact naming so tag builds can be promoted directly into release assets
- Bumped crate versioning to `0.1.1`

### Fixed

- Reasoning, MCP, skills, and behavior state now render as dedicated TUI surfaces instead of raw merged text
- Missing or invalid TOML configuration files now fail with user-facing diagnostics instead of silently falling back

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- ReAct orchestration loop with streaming-first architecture
- Tolerant XML parser for tool call detection with early execution
- OpenAI API client with SSE streaming support
- Dynamic JSON Schema generation from Rust structs (`schemars`)
- Tool registry with 17 built-in tools:
  - `file_read`, `file_write`, `terminal`, `code_execution`
  - `web_search` (DuckDuckGo Lite scraper), `web_fetch`, `http_request`
  - `datetime` with timezone offsets and advanced formatting
  - `memory_store`, `memory_search`, `memory_profile`
  - `todo` (in-memory task list), `clarify` (agent-to-user questioning)
  - `patch` (find-and-replace file patching)
- MCP protocol client with HTTP and stdio transports
- Persistent file-backed memory (`MEMORY.md` / `USER.md`) matching Python agent format
- Skills system with YAML front matter parsing
- Gateway adapters for Telegram, Discord, and Slack
- Context window management with compression
- RL trajectory export
- Cross-platform utilities (`platform.rs`) for shell detection, config dirs, file permissions
- CLI with `run`, `chat`, `tools`, and `test` subcommands
- 99 unit and integration tests
- CI/CD pipelines: lint (rustfmt + clippy + docs), build (3 native + 6 cross-compiled targets), test (3 platforms + coverage)

### Changed

- Switched TLS backend from `native-tls` (OpenSSL) to `rustls-tls` (pure Rust) for cross-compilation support

### Dependencies

- Rust MSRV: 1.86
- `tokio` 1.36, `reqwest` 0.12 (rustls), `serde` 1.0, `clap` 4.5
